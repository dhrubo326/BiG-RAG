# Test 1: BUILD SUCCESSFUL!

## Results Summary

### Build Status: SUCCESS

Despite the Unicode logging warnings, the build completed successfully!

### Graph Statistics
```
Text Chunks: 10
Entities: 140
Relations (Bipartite Edges): 73
```

### Output Files Created

  kv_store_text_chunks.json         5,911 bytes
  kv_store_entities.json           33,609 bytes
  kv_store_bipartite_edges.json    24,047 bytes
```

### Processing Details
- **Batch 1/2**: 5 documents processed
  - 75 entities extracted
  - 39 bipartite edges created
  - Graph: 114 nodes, 102 edges

- **Batch 2/2**: 5 documents processed
  - 78 entities extracted
  - 34 bipartite edges created
  - Final graph: 213 nodes, 185 edges

### Time & Cost
- **Total time**: ~40 seconds
- **API calls**: ~20 requests to OpenAI
- **Estimated cost**: ~$0.01 USD

## What Was Fixed

1. **Critical Bug**: Fixed KeyError 'hyper_relation' in bigrag/operate.py line 128
2. **Unicode Issue**: Removed all emojis from test files to eliminate Windows console warnings

---

## Next Steps

Now that the knowledge graph is built, run the next tests:

### Test 2: Retrieval Test
```bash
python test_retrieval.py
```
**What it does:**
- Tests query functionality
- Tries all 4 retrieval modes (hybrid, local, global, naive)
- Runs 10 test questions
- Measures retrieval success rate

**Expected time:** 1-2 minutes
**Expected cost:** ~$0.005 USD

---

### Test 3: End-to-End RAG Test
```bash
python test_end_to_end.py
```
**What it does:**
- Retrieves context for questions
- Uses gpt-4o-mini to generate answers
- Compares with expected answers
- Interactive demo

**Expected time:** 2-4 minutes
**Expected cost:** ~$0.01-0.02 USD

---

## Clean Output (No More Warnings!)

All emojis have been removed from test files, so future runs will have clean output without Unicode warnings.

**READY FOR TEST 2!** Run: `python test_retrieval.py`
