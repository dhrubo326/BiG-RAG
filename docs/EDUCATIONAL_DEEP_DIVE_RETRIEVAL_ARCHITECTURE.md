## Executive Summary

### What is BiG-RAG?

**BiG-RAG** (Bipartite Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced RAG system that combines:

1. **Bipartite Graph Representation** - Preserves n-ary relations between entities
2. **Dual-Path Vector Retrieval** - Simultaneously searches entities and relations
3. **Adaptive Multi-Hop Traversal** - Query complexity determines traversal depth
4. **Multi-Factor Coherence Scoring** - Ranks results by 5 coherence factors

### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | BiG-RAG Approach |
|--------|------------------|
| **Graph Structure** | Bipartite (entities ↔ relations as separate node types) |
| **Retrieval Style** | Dual-path vector similarity (entities + relations) |
| **Traversal** | Adaptive BFS (3-15 hops based on query complexity) |
| **Training Required** | ❌ No (zero-shot using pretrained LLMs) |
| **Query Processing** | spaCy NER + LLM entity extraction |
| **Ranking** | 5-factor coherence: similarity, hop distance, centrality, confidence, overlap |
| **Strength** | No training needed + adaptive depth + accurate results |
| **Use Case** | Production RAG with complex multi-hop reasoning |

### The Core Innovation

BiG-RAG's innovation is **not** introducing new retrieval primitives (vector search exists), but rather:

1. **Bipartite graph encoding** preserves complete n-ary relation semantics
2. **Dual-path retrieval** matches both entities AND relations simultaneously
3. **Adaptive traversal** adjusts depth based on query linguistic complexity
4. **Multi-factor coherence** ranks by structural + semantic relevance

## Foundational Concepts

### What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Traditional RAG Workflow:**
```
User Question
    ↓
Chunk-Based Retrieval (vector similarity on text chunks)
    ↓
Retrieved Chunks → LLM Context
    ↓
LLM Generates Answer
```

**Problem:** Misses relationships between entities, retrieves isolated facts.

**GraphRAG Workflow (BiG-RAG):**
```
User Question
    ↓
Graph-Based Retrieval (vector similarity on entities + relations)
    ↓
Multi-Hop Traversal (follow graph edges to gather connected knowledge)
    ↓
Retrieved Knowledge Subgraph → LLM Context
    ↓
LLM Generates Answer with Structured Knowledge
```

**Benefit:** Captures entity relationships and multi-hop reasoning paths.

### Why Bipartite Graphs?

**Problem with Traditional Graphs:**

Traditional knowledge graphs use binary edges:
```
Entity A ──relation──> Entity B
```

**Real-world facts involve multiple entities:**
> "Male hypertensive patients with serum creatinine 115-133 µmol/L are diagnosed with mild serum creatinine elevation"

**Binary decomposition loses context:**
```
(Patient, Gender, Male)
(Patient, Condition, Hypertension)
(Patient, Lab_Range, 115-133 µmol/L)
(Patient, Diagnosis, Mild Elevation)
```

**Problem:** You lose the constraint that ALL conditions must co-occur!

**Bipartite Graph Solution:**

│                                                             │
│ Edges ONLY connect different partitions                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Complete semantic preservation** - Natural language relation description
- ✅ **N-ary relations** - One relation node connects to N entities
- ✅ **Retrieval flexibility** - Can search entities OR relations
- ✅ **Graph traversal** - Follow edges to discover connected knowledge

## The Bipartite Graph Architecture

### Graph Structure

**Formal Definition:**

A bipartite graph `G = (V₁ ∪ V₂, E)` where:
- `V₁` = Entity nodes (e.g., "Einstein", "Relativity Theory", "1905")
- `V₂` = Relation nodes (e.g., "Einstein published relativity theory in 1905")
- `E` = Edges connecting `V₁` ↔ `V₂` (never `V₁` ↔ `V₁` or `V₂` ↔ `V₂`)

**Visual Example:**

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Example: Einstein Publishing Relativity Theory                   │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                   │
│ ENTITIES                        RELATIONS                         │
│                                                                   │
│ E1: "Einstein"         ←─┐                                       │
│                           ├─→  R1: "Einstein published           │
│ E2: "Relativity        ←─┤      relativity theory in 1905"      │
│      Theory"             │                                        │
│                           │                                        │
│ E3: "1905"             ←─┘                                       │
│                                                                   │

│                                                                   │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Storage Representation

**Three Core Storage Components:**

1. **Graph Storage (NetworkX GraphML)**
   ```python
   # Bipartite graph with two node types
   graph.nodes[node_id]["entity_type"] = "entity" or "relation"
   graph.add_edge(entity_node, relation_node, weight=1.0)
   ```

2. **Vector Storage (3 FAISS indices)**
   - `index_entity.bin` - Entity embeddings (1536-dim with bge-large-en-v1.5)
   - `index_bipartite_edge.bin` - Relation embeddings
   - `index_text_chunks.bin` - Original document chunk embeddings

3. **Key-Value Storage (JSON files)**
   ```json
   // kv_store_entities.json
   {
     "entity_id_1": {
       "entity_name": "EINSTEIN",
       "entity_type": "PERSON",
       "description": "Albert Einstein (1879-1955), physicist",
       "source_id": "chunk_42"
     }
   }

   // kv_store_bipartite_edges.json
   {
     "relation_id_1": {
       "src_id": "EINSTEIN",
       "tgt_id": "RELATIVITY THEORY",
       "keywords": "published, developed",
       "weight": 0.95,
       "description": "Einstein published relativity theory in 1905",
       "source_id": "chunk_42"
     }
   }
   ```

### Why This Architecture?

**Separation of Concerns:**
1. **Graph Storage** - Captures topology (who connects to what)
2. **Vector Storage** - Enables fast similarity search
3. **KV Storage** - Stores rich metadata (descriptions, types, sources)

**Performance Benefits:**
- FAISS vector search: O(log n) with HNSW index
- NetworkX graph traversal: O(E) where E = edges in subgraph
- JSON KV lookup: O(1) dictionary access

## Dual-Path Vector Retrieval

### The Core Retrieval Primitive

**Traditional RAG:**
```
Query → Embed → Search Text Chunks → Retrieve Top-K
```

**BiG-RAG Dual-Path:**
```
Query → Embed → BOTH:
                  ├─→ Search Entities → Top-K entity matches
                  └─→ Search Relations → Top-K relation matches
```

### Why Dual-Path?

**Example Query:** *"What did Einstein publish in 1905?"*

**Entity-Only Retrieval Would Find:**
- ✅ "Einstein" (high similarity)
- ✅ "1905" (high similarity)
- ❌ **Misses:** The specific relation "published relativity theory"

**Relation-Only Retrieval Would Find:**
- ✅ "Einstein published relativity theory in 1905" (high similarity)
- ❌ **Misses:** Other Einstein facts from 1905 (patent office work, PhD)

**Dual-Path Retrieval Finds:**
- ✅ Entities: "Einstein", "1905", "Relativity Theory"
- ✅ Relations: "Einstein published relativity theory in 1905"
- ✅ **Bonus:** Graph traversal connects both paths!

### Implementation Details

**Step 1: Query Embedding**
```python
# Embed user query with same model used for indexing
query_embedding = embedding_model.encode([query])  # Shape: (1, 1536)
```

**Step 2: Dual Vector Search**
```python
# Search entity index
entity_scores, entity_ids = index_entity.search(
    query_embedding, k=10  # Top-10 entities
)

# Search relation index
relation_scores, relation_ids = index_bipartite_edge.search(
    query_embedding, k=10  # Top-10 relations
)
```

**Step 3: Retrieve Metadata**
```python
# Get entity details from KV store
matched_entities = [kv_store_entities[id] for id in entity_ids[0]]

# Get relation details from KV store
matched_relations = [kv_store_bipartite_edges[id] for id in relation_ids[0]]
```

### Similarity Metrics

**FAISS Inner Product Search:**
```
similarity(query, entity) = query · entity / (||query|| * ||entity||)
```

**Range:** [-1, 1] where:
- `1.0` = Perfect match (identical vectors)
- `0.0` = Orthogonal (no similarity)
- `-1.0` = Opposite (rare in practice)

**Threshold:** BiG-RAG uses `similarity > 0.7` as default cutoff.

---

## Multi-Hop Graph Traversal

### Why Multi-Hop?

**Single-Hop Retrieval:**
```
Query: "What did Einstein's wife study?"

Retrieved:
- Entity: "Einstein" (direct match)
- Relation: "Einstein married Mileva Marić" (direct match)

Answer: "Mileva Marić" ← INCOMPLETE!
```

**Two-Hop Retrieval:**
```
Hop 1: "Einstein" → "Einstein married Mileva Marić"
Hop 2: "Mileva Marić" → "Mileva Marić studied physics and mathematics"

Answer: "Physics and mathematics" ← COMPLETE!
```

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal

**Algorithm:**
```
1. Start with dual-path retrieved nodes (entities + relations)
2. Add to visited set
3. For each depth level (up to max_hops):
   a. Get neighbors of current frontier nodes
   b. Filter by bipartite constraint (entities ↔ relations only)
   c. Add unvisited neighbors to next frontier
   d. Update visited set
4. Return all visited nodes
```

**Visual Example:**
```
Depth 0 (Initial):  ["Einstein"]
        ↓
Depth 1 (Neighbors):  [R1: "Einstein published relativity",
                       R2: "Einstein married Mileva Marić"]
        ↓
Depth 2 (Neighbors):  ["Relativity Theory", "1905", "Mileva Marić"]
        ↓
Depth 3 (Neighbors):  [R3: "Mileva Marić studied physics",
                       R4: "Relativity theory explains gravity"]
```

### Adaptive Depth Control

**Query Complexity Classification:**

BiG-RAG uses spaCy + linguistic analysis to classify queries:

```python
def analyze_query_complexity(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Returns: "SIMPLE" | "MODERATE" | "COMPLEX"
    """
    # Factors:
    # - Number of entities mentioned
    # - Presence of conjunctions ("and", "or")
    # - Question type (who/what vs. why/how)
    # - Sentence structure complexity

    if num_entities <= 1 and simple_question_type:
        return "SIMPLE"     # 3-5 hops
    elif num_entities <= 2 or moderate_complexity:
        return "MODERATE"   # 5-10 hops
    else:
        return "COMPLEX"    # 10-15 hops
```

**Adaptive Hop Depths:**

| Complexity | Hops | Example Query |
|------------|------|---------------|
| SIMPLE | 3-5 | "Who is Einstein?" |
| MODERATE | 5-10 | "What did Einstein publish?" |
| COMPLEX | 10-15 | "How did Einstein's work influence quantum mechanics and cosmology?" |

**Why Adaptive?**
- ⚡ **Faster** for simple queries (fewer hops = less computation)
- 🎯 **More accurate** for complex queries (more hops = more context)
- 💰 **Cost-effective** (avoids unnecessary LLM token usage)

---

## Query Complexity Analysis

### The Linguistic Analysis Pipeline

**Step 1: spaCy NER (Named Entity Recognition)**
```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

doc = nlp("How did Einstein's relativity theory influence modern physics?")

# Extract entities
entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
# [("Einstein", "PERSON"), ("relativity theory", "WORK_OF_ART")]
```

**Step 2: Dependency Parsing**
```python
# Analyze sentence structure
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.dep_, token.head.text)

# Output:
# How advmod influence
# did aux influence
# Einstein poss theory
# 's case Einstein
# relativity compound theory
# theory nsubj influence
# influence ROOT influence
# modern amod physics
# physics dobj influence
```

**Step 3: Complexity Scoring**
```python
complexity_score = 0

# Factor 1: Number of entities
complexity_score += len(entities) * 2

# Factor 2: Dependency depth
complexity_score += max(token.i - token.head.i for token in doc)

# Factor 3: Question type
if query.startswith(("How", "Why", "Explain")):
    complexity_score += 5
elif query.startswith(("What", "When", "Where")):
    complexity_score += 2

# Factor 4: Conjunctions
complexity_score += query.count(" and ") + query.count(" or ")

# Classification
if complexity_score <= 5:
    return "SIMPLE", 3  # 3 hops
elif complexity_score <= 10:
    return "MODERATE", 7  # 7 hops
else:
    return "COMPLEX", 12  # 12 hops
```

### Example Classifications

**SIMPLE:** *"Who is Einstein?"*
```
Entities: 1 (Einstein)
Question type: "Who" (+2)
Dependency depth: Low (+1)
Score: 3 → SIMPLE → 3 hops
```

**MODERATE:** *"What did Einstein publish in 1905?"*
```
Entities: 2 (Einstein, 1905)
Question type: "What" (+2)
Temporal constraint: "in 1905" (+2)
Score: 8 → MODERATE → 7 hops
```

**COMPLEX:** *"How did Einstein's relativity theory influence modern physics and cosmology?"*
```
Entities: 3 (Einstein, relativity theory, physics, cosmology)
Question type: "How" (+5)
Conjunction: "and" (+1)
Dependency depth: High (+3)
Score: 15 → COMPLEX → 12 hops
```

## Coherence Scoring System

### Why Coherence Scoring?

After multi-hop traversal, we have hundreds of retrieved nodes. How do we rank them?

**Naive Approach (Vector Similarity Only):**
```
Rank by: similarity(query, node)
Problem: Ignores graph structure!
```

**Example Issue:**
```
Query: "Einstein's work in 1905"

High Similarity, Low Relevance:
- "Einstein's later work on quantum mechanics" (similar BUT wrong timeframe)

Lower Similarity, High Relevance:
- "Annus Mirabilis papers" (less similar BUT exactly the answer)
```

**BiG-RAG Solution:** Multi-factor coherence scoring.

### The 5 Coherence Factors

**1. Vector Similarity (40% weight)**
```python
similarity_score = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, node_embedding)
```
**Range:** [0, 1]
**Interpretation:** Semantic relevance to query

**2. Hop Distance (25% weight)**
```python
hop_penalty = 1.0 / (1.0 + hop_distance)
```
**Range:** [0, 1] (1.0 for hop 0, 0.5 for hop 1, 0.33 for hop 2, ...)
**Interpretation:** Prefer closer nodes (less inference needed)

**3. Node Centrality (15% weight)**
```python
# PageRank-style centrality in bipartite graph
centrality = graph.degree(node_id) / max_degree
```
**Range:** [0, 1]
**Interpretation:** Important hub nodes rank higher

**4. Confidence Score (10% weight)**
```python
# From LLM extraction (GPT-4o-mini assigns confidence)
confidence = node_metadata.get("confidence", 0.8)
```
**Range:** [0, 1]
**Interpretation:** How confident the LLM was during extraction

**5. Entity Overlap (10% weight)**
```python
query_entities = extract_entities(query)
node_entities = extract_entities(node_description)
overlap = len(query_entities & node_entities) / len(query_entities)
```
**Range:** [0, 1]
**Interpretation:** Direct entity mention overlap

### Combined Coherence Score

```python
def compute_coherence(query, node, hop_distance, graph):
    """
    Returns: Float in [0, 1] representing overall coherence
    """
    # Factor 1: Vector similarity
    sim = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, node.embedding)

    # Factor 2: Hop distance penalty
    hop_penalty = 1.0 / (1.0 + hop_distance)

    # Factor 3: Node centrality
    centrality = graph.degree(node.id) / graph.max_degree

    # Factor 4: Extraction confidence
    confidence = node.metadata.get("confidence", 0.8)

    # Factor 5: Entity overlap
    overlap = entity_overlap(query, node.description)

    # Weighted combination
    coherence = (
        0.40 * sim +
        0.25 * hop_penalty +
        0.15 * centrality +
        0.10 * confidence +
        0.10 * overlap
    )

    return coherence
```

### Ranking Example

**Query:** *"What did Einstein publish in 1905?"*

| Node | Similarity | Hop | Centrality | Confidence | Overlap | **Coherence** |
|------|------------|-----|------------|------------|---------|---------------|
| "Relativity Theory" | 0.92 | 1 | 0.85 | 0.95 | 0.67 | **0.84** ← TOP |
| "Einstein" | 0.95 | 0 | 0.90 | 0.98 | 1.00 | **0.82** |
| "Annus Mirabilis Papers" | 0.78 | 2 | 0.60 | 0.90 | 0.50 | **0.68** |
| "Quantum Mechanics" | 0.85 | 3 | 0.75 | 0.88 | 0.33 | **0.64** |
| "Patent Office" | 0.70 | 2 | 0.40 | 0.85 | 0.33 | **0.56** |

**Result:** "Relativity Theory" ranks highest despite lower similarity than "Einstein" because of better hop distance and entity overlap!

## Performance Optimization

### Retrieval Speed

**Bottlenecks:**
1. FAISS vector search: ~10-50ms for 10K nodes
2. Graph BFS traversal: ~50-200ms for 12 hops
3. Coherence scoring: ~100-500ms for 300 nodes
4. LLM generation: ~1-5 seconds (dominates)

**Optimization Strategies:**

**1. FAISS Index Type**
```python
# Slow but accurate (for <100K nodes)
index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(dimension)  # Exact search

# Fast for >100K nodes
index = faiss.IndexHNSWFlat(dimension, M=32)  # Approximate search
```

**2. Parallel Coherence Scoring**
```python
# Use asyncio for parallel computation
async def score_node_async(node_id, hop_dist):
    return await compute_coherence(query, node_id, hop_dist, graph)

scores = await asyncio.gather(*[
    score_node_async(node, hop) for node, hop in all_nodes
])
```

**3. Caching**
```python
# Cache entity embeddings
@lru_cache(maxsize=10000)
def get_entity_embedding(entity_id):
    return embedding_model.encode([entity_id])

# Cache graph neighborhoods
@lru_cache(maxsize=5000)
def get_neighbors(node_id):
    return list(graph.neighbors(node_id))
```

**4. Early Stopping in BFS**
```python
# Stop expansion when frontier grows too large
if len(frontier) > 1000:
    break  # Avoid exponential explosion
```

### Memory Optimization

**Problem:** Large knowledge graphs consume significant RAM.

**Solutions:**

**1. Memory-Mapped FAISS Indices**
```python
# Load index without copying to RAM
index = faiss.read_index("index_entity.bin", faiss.IO_FLAG_MMAP)
```

**2. Lazy Loading of KV Store**
```python
# Don't load entire JSON into memory
class LazyKVStore:
    def __init__(self, path):
        self.path = path
        self._cache = {}

    def get(self, key):
        if key not in self._cache:
            # Load only requested entry
            with open(self.path) as f:
                data = json.load(f)
                self._cache[key] = data[key]
        return self._cache[key]
```

**3. Graph Serialization**
```python
# Use GraphML for efficient storage
import networkx as nx

# Save
nx.write_graphml(graph, "graph.graphml")

# Load (lazy)
graph = nx.read_graphml("graph.graphml")
```

### Accuracy Optimization

**1. Tune Coherence Weights**
```python
# A/B test different weight configurations
weights = {
    "similarity": 0.40,    # Increase for semantic accuracy
    "hop_distance": 0.25,  # Increase for direct facts preference
    "centrality": 0.15,    # Increase for authoritative nodes
    "confidence": 0.10,
    "entity_overlap": 0.10
}
```

**2. Adaptive Top-K**
```python
# Vary number of retrieved nodes by complexity
if complexity == "SIMPLE":
    top_k = 10
elif complexity == "MODERATE":
    top_k = 20
else:
    top_k = 30
```

**3. Hybrid Retrieval**
```python
# Combine graph retrieval with chunk retrieval
graph_results = graph_retrieve(query, top_k=15)
chunk_results = chunk_retrieve(query, top_k=5)

# Merge and re-rank
all_results = merge_and_rerank(graph_results, chunk_results)
```

## Implementation Guide

### Building a BiG-RAG System from Scratch

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install bigrag torch transformers faiss-cpu networkx spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**Step 2: Initialize BiG-RAG**
```python
from bigrag import BiGRAG

rag = BiGRAG(
    working_dir="./bigrag_cache",
    embedding_dim=1536,  # bge-large-en-v1.5
    llm_model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)
```

**Step 3: Index Documents**
```python
documents = [
    "Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a theoretical physicist.",
    "Einstein developed the theory of relativity in the early 20th century.",
    "In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.",
    # ... more documents
]

# Insert documents (automatic chunking, entity extraction, graph building)
await rag.ainsert(documents)

# Save indices
rag.save_indices("./indices/")
```

**Step 4: Query**
```python
query = "What did Einstein publish in 1905?"

# Retrieve + generate
result = await rag.aquery(query)

print(result["answer"])
# "Einstein published four groundbreaking papers in 1905..."

print(result["context"][:3])
# Top-3 retrieved knowledge nodes
```

**Step 5: Production Deployment**
```python
# Option A: REST API
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/query")
async def query_endpoint(query: str):
    result = await rag.aquery(query)
    return result

# Option B: Batch Processing
queries = ["query1", "query2", ...]
results = await asyncio.gather(*[rag.aquery(q) for q in queries])
```

### Advanced Configuration

**Custom Coherence Weights:**
```python
rag = BiGRAG(
    coherence_weights={
        "similarity": 0.50,      # Emphasize semantic match
        "hop_distance": 0.20,
        "centrality": 0.15,
        "confidence": 0.10,
        "entity_overlap": 0.05
    }
)
```

**Custom Complexity Thresholds:**
```python
rag = BiGRAG(
    complexity_hops={
        "SIMPLE": 3,
        "MODERATE": 8,    # Increase for more thorough retrieval
        "COMPLEX": 15
    }
)
```

**Custom Storage Backends:**
```python
rag = BiGRAG(
    vector_storage="FAISSVectorStorage",  # or "MilvusVectorStorage"
    graph_storage="Neo4jGraphStorage",    # or "NetworkXStorage"
    kv_storage="JsonKVStorage"            # or "MongoKVStorage"
)
```

## Conclusion

BiG-RAG's retrieval architecture combines:

1. **Bipartite Graphs** - Preserve n-ary relation semantics
2. **Dual-Path Retrieval** - Match entities AND relations
3. **Adaptive Traversal** - Query complexity drives depth
4. **Multi-Factor Coherence** - Structural + semantic ranking

This results in a production-ready GraphRAG system that requires **no training**, adapts to query complexity, and delivers accurate multi-hop reasoning.

### Key Takeaways

✅ **Bipartite encoding** preserves complete relational context
✅ **Dual-path retrieval** finds both entities and their relationships
✅ **BFS traversal** discovers multi-hop reasoning paths
✅ **Complexity analysis** optimizes retrieval depth dynamically
✅ **Coherence scoring** ranks by structural + semantic relevance
